		<h1>Project Description</h1>
		<p>Building upon the prototype from the midterm project, we chose to make an<br> even cleaner hangman game with added features for the player to interact with.</p>
	</div>

	<!--design section-->
	<div class="design">
		<h1>Design Considerations</h1>
		<p>To create a clean and cohesive look to the webpage, we used the same color palette<br> and font on the splash and game page. And because this is a game, we chose an arcade<br> style font to give it a more interesting aesthetic. The buttons on the game page<br> are all centered to allow for easier player navigation.</p>
	</div>

	<!--challenges section-->
	<div class="challenges">
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>The biggest challenge came when we were trying to find a color palette that had<br> different hues and tones while still being cohesive. Another tedious challenge<br> that we faced was placing the hangman figure parts in the correct position, which<br> we solved through trial and error.</p>
	</div>

	<!--technology/acknowledgements section-->
	<div class="tech">
		<h1>Technology & Recognition</h1>
		<p>In addition to the string arrays, global variables, and helper functions that were<br> present in the prototype, we also introduced the window.onload event handler to<br> load everything to the page upon starting.</p>
	</div>

	<!--a back button to go to homepage-->
	<div class="backButton">
